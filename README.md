## About the Project
- **Goal**: To develop and validate a deep neural network model that enhances SRS images beyond their native spatial resolution.  
- **Approach**: Combines advanced image reconstruction techniques, deep learning, and domain-specific knowledge in Raman spectroscopy.  
- **Applications**: Biological imaging, materials analysis, and other scientific fields that rely on Raman spectroscopy.

Here, you can include an overview of:
1. The main objective: super-resolve SRS images.  
2. The types of deep learning models or frameworks you explore (e.g., CNNs, GANs, Transformers).  
3. Why super-resolution is valuable for SRS imaging.

---

## Features
- **Super-Resolution Model**: Enhanced image details from low-resolution SRS acquisitions.  
- **Noise Reduction**: Integrated denoising methods to handle signal-to-noise issues inherent to Raman imaging.  
- **Flexible Architecture**: Pluggable modules to experiment with different deep learning backbones.  
- **Easy-to-Use API**: Straightforward interfaces for training, inference, and evaluation.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

~~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/RogueLiquid/DeepSRS.git
cd DeepRaman
~~~~

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:

~~~~bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
~~~~

3. **Install dependencies**:

~~~~bash
pip install -r ESRGAN_requirements.txt
~~~~

~~~~bash
pip install -r ResShift_requirements.txt
~~~~

---

## Usage
Provide instructions for how to run the primary scripts or functions of DeepSRS. For example:

1. **Prepare your SRS data**:  
   - Organize your SRS data into a folder, the data format is tiff (ends with .tif).
   - Organize your processed data into a folder, the data format is png (ends with .png).

2. **Inference**:

   - To run our program for super-resolution, you can:

~~~~bash
# Run the autoencoder:
python run_autoencoder.py --input <input_tiff_folder> --output <output_tiff_folder>

# Run the ESRGAN:
python run_ESRGAN.py --input <input_image_folder> --output <output_image_folder>

# Run the ResShift
python run_ResShift.py --input <input_image_folder> --output <output_image_folder>
